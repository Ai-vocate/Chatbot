It is important to consult with an attorney who specializes in probate law to address the specific details of your case. Generally, in the absence of court approval or a valid power of attorney, an individual does not have the legal authority to sell property on behalf of the estate or other owners. The probate process typically involves court supervision to ensure the proper distribution of assets. If your brother signed a contract to sell the house before court approval, it may raise concerns about the validity of the transaction. Consulting with an attorney who specializes in probate law can provide guidance on how to proceed and protect your rights in this matter. - James L.

It is frustrating when a company fails to provide timely resolution to such issues. It is advisable to continue engaging with AXS and documenting your communications with them. Additionally, reaching out to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and filing a complaint can help escalate the matter and potentially prompt a quicker response from AXS. Keep records of any relevant documentation, such as proof of ticket sales and fees paid, as evidence to support your case. If the issue persists and you are unable to resolve it directly with AXS, seeking legal advice from an attorney specializing in consumer rights or small claims court may be an option to explore.

A re-entry permit allows a lawful permanent resident to apply for admission to the United States upon returning from abroad during the permit\u2019s validity without the need to obtain a returning resident visa from a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate. Re-entry permits are generally valid for 2 years from the date of issuance. Therefore, if you are outside of the United States longer than the date the permit was issued (assuming no permit was requested in your case) or, if you are overseas in excess of 1 year, you may be denied entry into the United States. The key word is \"may\" because the CBP officer may grant entry for good cause shown or may deny it and consider the permanent residency status abandoned. In practice, there are many cases when green card holders are allowed entry after 1 year period, especially if no previous warning was noted. I think the airline will allow you to board the flight to the USA if your Green Card is not expired. If the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer believes you do not intend to continue living permanently in the United States, he\/she may revoke your status as a permanent resident. At that point, it is better to have a stand-by attorney who may represent you. You should take into account that every case is unique and it is strongly recommended to discuss your particular case with an immigration attorney and be duly prepared for a negative outcome on re-entry.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can I name my company Smooch if there is a company named Smoochcraft in the same industry? - California Business Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                The names I am using are not real companies but the answers applies to the company I am trying to start.

You likely do not have a claim against the finance company under those circumstances. If you have never paid your car note late, it is difficult to understand how you might have accrues late fees.  Ordinarily, a late fee is charged only when the borrower makes a payment later (hence the name \"late\" fee).   Car loans generally are not assumable, so it would be a highly unusual transaction if you assumed a previous car loan to another borrower that somehow already had accrued $2,600 in late fees.  Typically, a new owner of a previously-owned vehicle takes out their own loan for the purchase of the used vehicle, and the proceeds of that loan pay off the previous loan of the prior owner.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can a non profit give to the CEOs side business? - California Contracts Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                I'm on the board of a animal welfare\/rights organization and the CEO has a side business where he only provides foods that our vegan.

If you and your parents are all tenants in common (they own an undivided one-half and you own an undivided one-half of the property but there's no right of survivorship, you will need a court order establishing that you now own their one-half of the property.  If it can be established that the fair market value of their one-half of the property is under $185K, there is a simplified probate procedure that can be completed within 60 days at a substantial cost savings to a full probate.  If it can be established that the property is (or was intended to be) trust-owned property, there's another probate procedure that you can use to establish the existence of the trust, the name of the trustee, and the properly belonging to the trust (referred to as a Heggstad petition), which can also be completed within 60 days at a substantial cost savings to a full probate.

To assess whether your first attorney or second attorney may be at fault for the negative outcomes you experienced, you would need to consult with a qualified attorney who can review the details of your case. Here are a few points to consider: Communication with your attorney: It is generally expected that attorneys should keep their clients informed about important developments in their case, including any decision to withdraw as counsel. If your first attorney removed himself as your attorney and failed to inform you, it could potentially raise issues of professional conduct or ethical obligations. Responsibility of your second attorney: When you hired a new attorney, they assumed the responsibility to represent your interests. If they were unable to secure a court date or failed to effectively address your concerns regarding the plea, it may be necessary to evaluate whether they fulfilled their professional obligations to you.

It states that if a court finds that a parent has committed domestic violence against the other parent within the past five years, there is a rebuttable presumption that granting custody to the abusive parent is not in the best interest of the child. However, family law cases can be complex, and judges have discretion in making custody determinations based on the specific facts and evidence presented in each case. While Family Code Section 3044 establishes a presumption, it doesn't mean that a judge must automatically deny custody to a parent who has committed domestic violence. The presumption can be rebutted if the accused parent can provide evidence to challenge it or demonstrate that it is not in the child's best interest to deny them custody. If you believe that your concerns about domestic violence are not being adequately addressed or that the court is ignoring the evidence you have presented, it may be beneficial to consult with a family law attorney. They can provide guidance based on their knowledge of your specific circumstances and the relevant laws in your jurisdiction. An attorney can help you understand your rights, navigate the legal process, and present your case effectively in court.

However, your lease states that the property is not subject to these rent limits, citing Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code. Section 1947.12 (d)(5) of the Civil Code exempts certain types of properties from rent control ordinances, including those where the owner is not a real estate investment trust, corporation, or a limited liability company with at least one corporate member. Section 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code pertains to just cause eviction protections, which are separate from rent control. Based on the information provided in your lease, it appears that the property you are renting falls within the exemptions mentioned, and therefore the landlord may not be bound by the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12. Consequently, the landlord may have the ability to increase the rent as they see fit, as long as they comply with other applicable laws and regulations. It is important to note that this response is a general analysis based on the information provided and does not constitute legal advice.

If back property taxes are not paid, the local government may initiate a tax foreclosure process, which could lead to the property being sold at a tax sale or auction. If there are other individuals with potential claims to the property, such as the daughter of the deceased owner in this case, it can further complicate the situation. It is crucial to consult with a local attorney who can review the specific circumstances, including any relevant documentation or agreements, and provide accurate advice based on the applicable laws in your area.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"I was accused and arrested for a crime I didn\u2019t commit.

It says no court shall authorize support at anytime but I\u2019m scared he will request in response to the restraining orders.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf both parties have waived spousal support in the judgment, it is typically difficult for the court to later issue spousal support. However, specific laws and provisions can vary by jurisdiction, so it's important to review the language in your judgment. Restraining orders and spousal support are separate matters. While your ex-spouse may request spousal support in response to the restraining orders, the court will likely consider the waiver in the judgment.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Is there a template when a trustee in a trust has  not begun trustee duties and wishes not to be the trustee? - California Estate Planning Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                How does a named trustee formally decline being a trustee on a trust?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe are templates available online ($).

He works for the company, gets paid from the company, uses the company van for work, and his apartment rent and other utilities bills are also paid by the company that is located in another state.  If that employee committed an intentional tort to injure another tenant in the same apartment building, can this injured tenant sue that violator and his company (for the negligence of not managing its employee well and did not take action to rectify its employee's illegal acts)?  If the necessity to sue the violator's employer for the monetary compensation is so compulsory and indispensable, should the victim sue both the violator and his company in State Court or Federal Court?  With regards to the venue of the lawsuit, should the victim file his lawsuit in Santa Clara County of CA (where the intentional tort had occurred)?  Or sue in the County of another state in which the violator 's employer is located?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is unusual a company would be liable  for the intentional tort of an employee, especially if it had nothing to do with his employment.

Details My understanding is that when a company has a mass layoff and then give the cal warn notice that they will have to make two months of payment separate from other compensations such as severance. Is this the case? Another thing is I was awarded restricted stock units and now because of this layoff I will be off by 14 days from vesting even though I will have completed a year worth of work.

The California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas based on age, among other protected characteristics. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule. One such exception is the Housing for Older Persons Act (HOPA), which allows certain housing communities to establish age restrictions. HOPA applies to housing communities that meet certain criteria, including that at least 80% of the units are occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older, and that the community provides certain services or facilities specifically designed for older persons. While HOPA specifically applies to housing communities, there may be other laws or regulations that allow nonprofits to establish activities restricted to individuals age 55 and up.

Additionally, Landlord wants a full repaint for the apartment.  I acknowledge that I owe for a partial re-paint, but I dispute that I owe for a full repaint.  I also dispute cleaning charges since we spent an entire weekend cleaning the place. Landlord attached a blank move-in inspection form to support move-out charges, which was not the one I submitted.  The landlord uses an electronic system to process work orders.  For the first few orders, I did not have to submit for repairs since they were a result of the move-in inspection and the landlord submitted them on my behalf.

Review your lease agreement: Your lease agreement may outline the specific requirements for move-out and any charges that may be assessed for cleaning or repairs. Reviewing your lease agreement can help you understand your rights and obligations. 2. Request a meeting with the landlord: Request a meeting with your landlord to discuss the move-out charges and provide any evidence you have to support your dispute. Be prepared to provide documentation, such as receipts or photos, to support your position. 3. Consider mediation: If you are unable to resolve the dispute with your landlord directly, you may want to consider mediation. Mediation is a process where a neutral third party helps facilitate a resolution between the parties. Many cities and states have mediation programs specifically for landlord-tenant disputes. 4. File a complaint: If you are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation or negotiation, you may want to file a complaint with your state's attorney general's office or housing authority. They may be able to investigate the matter and help resolve the dispute. In terms of the lost move-in inspection form, you may want to provide any evidence you have to support your position, such as emails or work orders that show the condition of the apartment at move-in. If the landlord is unable to provide the move-in inspection form, they may have a more difficult time proving that any damage or cleaning charges are warranted.

If the warrant was issued a long time ago and you were not aware of it until recently, you may be able to argue that the warrant is no longer valid due to the passage of time. However, this will depend on the specific laws in your jurisdiction and the reasons for the warrant.

Then the lawyer was made backup trustee as well. - California Estate Planning Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChanging a will multiple times is not necessarily a red flag in and of itself, as people's circumstances and wishes can change over time. However, changing a will 22 times may raise questions about the person's decision-making process and whether they were of sound mind and fully aware of the changes they were making. Additionally, appointing the lawyer as a backup trustee may raise concerns about conflicts of interest or undue influence. It's important to ensure that the person making the changes to their will is doing so voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If you have concerns about the validity of the will or the actions of the lawyer, you may want to consult with a legal professional or seek advice from a trusted advisor. It's important to ensure that the person's wishes are being respected and that their estate is being handled in accordance with their wishes and the law.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"So I hired a electrician to check why is my house working on half power, after almost 300 dollars fee just to see what - California Municipal Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                The electrician said is PGE responsibility, PGE check out the wiring and said is my responsibility, who is wrong,the electrician that didn't even provide a invoice or PGE trying to dodge the bill?

However, it's important to approach the situation calmly and rationally in order to find a solution. First, you should try to get a clear understanding of what is causing the issue with your electrical service. If the electrician you hired was unable to provide a clear diagnosis, you may want to consider hiring another electrician for a second opinion. It's also possible that the issue is related to the electrical service provided by the utility company, in which case you may need to work with them to resolve the issue. If you believe that the utility company is responsible for the issue, you should try to work with them to resolve the problem. This may involve filing a complaint with the utility company or contacting your state's public utilities commission for assistance. It's important to keep in mind that utility companies have the legal authority to shut off service for non-payment. However, they are required to follow certain procedures and provide notice before doing so. If you are having difficulty paying your bill, you may want to contact the utility company to discuss payment options or assistance programs that may be available. Overall, it's important to approach the situation with a level head and try to work with the utility company to find a solution. If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, you may want to consider seeking legal advice or contacting a consumer advocacy organization for assistance.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Does the California Penal Code Section 645 make any distinctions between male and female sex offenders? - California Criminal Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                The California Penal Code Section 645 states that any person guilty of a second conviction of a sex crime against a victim under 13 years of age must, upon parole, undergo medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. However does this law only apply to male offenders or also female?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe California Penal Code Section 645 applies to all persons convicted of a second sex crime against a victim under 13 years of age, regardless of their gender. The law does not make any distinctions between male and female sex offenders. Medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment, also known as chemical castration, is a medical treatment that reduces the production of testosterone and other hormones in the body. This treatment is used to reduce the risk of reoffending in sex offenders, particularly those who have committed crimes against children. While chemical castration is often associated with male sex offenders, it can also be used to treat female sex offenders. In fact, some states in the US have laws that require chemical castration for both male and female sex offenders. It's important to note that chemical castration is a controversial treatment and is not always effective in preventing reoffending. It's also important to ensure that any medical treatment is administered ethically and with the informed consent of the patient.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"What rights does my mom have ? - California Personal Injury Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                She went to Kaiser for a bowel obstruction & had a massive stroke due to her doctor taking her off blood thinners the surgery was in necessary & never happened, she was fully independent & now needs to round the clock nurses\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes there may be a case.

Our RFO custody hearing is scheduled for the end of August. Despite the Emergency Joint Custody order, my wife is still insisting on sole custody and dictating my visitation schedules, thus disregarding the court order. I haven't seen my 3-year-old son due to this. I have requested parenting time for Father's Day weekend, from Saturday to Monday, via her YWCA attorney, and I am currently waiting for their response.

I'd be happy to help you understand California Corporations Code \u00a7 5240 subsection (c) and its implications for your nonprofit organization. California Corporations Code \u00a7 5240 subsection (c) pertains to the distribution of assets upon the dissolution of a nonprofit organization. Here's an explanation of the subsection in simpler terms: The subsection states that upon the dissolution of a nonprofit organization, any remaining assets must be distributed to another nonprofit organization with a similar purpose, to the federal government, or to a state or local government. If the organization has specific provisions in its governing documents (such as articles of incorporation or bylaws) regarding the distribution of assets upon dissolution, those provisions will prevail over subsection (c) unless they are inconsistent with California law. If the organization's governing documents are silent on the matter of asset distribution upon dissolution, subsection (c) comes into effect as the default rule. In summary, subsection (c) ensures that when a nonprofit organization is dissolved, its remaining assets are directed towards other charitable or governmental entities, rather than being distributed to private individuals or shareholders.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can I submit an i589 to USCIS or can I only submit an I589 to EOIR in my current situation? - California Immigration Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                In late December 2022, I(from China mainland\uff09entered the U.S. illegally through the wall from Mexico, and was caught by CBP and held in the border detention center.

It appears the woman is trying to impose a \"common law marriage\" by claiming to have lived with the man for 8 years and having his children.  I do not believe California is a common law marriage state, but does recognize legally-binding common law marriages from other states.  Since the woman lacks a marriage certificate of any kind, and the man can produce proof he is legally married to someone else, he should probably file a \"Special Appearance\" objection\/motion for dismissal of the action based on fraud and lack of jurisdiction.

Good luck to you.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"If I have an existing llc with a partner me being primary owner & create a new with similar name different state.

A court-appointed attorney or public defender is likely to have far more experience and resources to assist you in your defense of this case than a pro bono attorney with a free legal clinic.   Remember that a detective may be putting down in his report what he was told, not necessarily what he personally witnessed.  Unless the detective has had prior personal dealings with you, it is difficult to imagine what his motive would be to lie.

However, without more specific information about the circumstances, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. If a child has been living with their parents for eight months and there are no known concerns or issues that would warrant intervention by DCFS, it is less likely for them to detain the child from the legal guardians. Generally, DCFS aims to prioritize the safety and well-being of the child and may only intervene if there is evidence of abuse, neglect, or an unsafe living environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"How much time does our neighbor legally have to finish the construction of the common wall between us? - California Real Estate Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                We have a rental and one of the neighbors is doing construction very slowly and our tenants are getting upset due the noise alone but we are aware we can\u2019t do much.

Since you reside in Washington (WA) and the financial planner is in California (CA), it is possible for him to file a lawsuit against you in either state. Seek legal advice: It is advisable to consult with an attorney who can assess the details of your case, including the specific laws that apply to your situation.

Gather evidence: Collect any evidence you have that supports your claim of being taken advantage of by the financial planner.

Mediation or negotiation: Consider exploring options for resolving the dispute outside of court, such as mediation or negotiation. This could potentially lead to a mutually acceptable resolution without the need for formal litigation.

Now alongside that employment, they want to own a business, which is not related to my formal education. The intention is not to leave the current job, but rather to operate this business concurrently. My primary question revolves around the legality of owning an LLC or business, as well as the collection of profits, given the visa status. While they may not receive direct payment, the intention is to collect profits generated by the business. I am curious to know if this is legally permissible under my current visa category.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, someone on an F-1 visa can own a business, but there are some restrictions. Under F-1 visa, international students are not allowed to work in the US unless they have authorization. Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a type of employment authorization that allows F-1 students to work in the US after graduation for up to 12 months. If you are currently on OPT and want to start a business, you will need to make sure that your business is related to your field of study. You will also need to make sure that you do not violate any of the terms of your OPT authorization. Here are some things to keep in mind: * You must obtain a Social Security number (SSN) for your business. * You must file taxes for your business. * You must comply with all applicable state and federal laws. * You must not work more than 20 hours per week on your business while you are on OPT. If you are unsure whether or not you can start a business while you are on OPT, you should consult with an immigration attorney. As for collecting profits, you can do so as long as you are paying taxes on them. However, you cannot use the profits to support yourself in the US. The profits must be used to support the business. If you are planning to leave the US and return to your home country, you can take the profits with you. However, you will need to pay taxes on them when you do so. It is important to note that starting a business while you are on F-1 visa can be risky. If you are not careful, you could violate the terms of your visa and be deported.

It sounds like you may have some legal rights to the phone, but it's important to speak with an attorney to get a definitive answer. In California, the law generally considers personal property to be part of the deceased person's estate. This means that the phone would likely be inherited by the deceased person's closest relatives, such as their spouse, children, or parents. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. One exception is if you paid for the phone. If you can prove that you paid for the phone, you may be able to claim ownership of it. You can do this by providing documentation, such as receipts or bank statements. Another exception is if you have a written agreement with the deceased person that gives you ownership of the phone. This could be a contract, a lease, or even just a simple agreement in writing. If you can prove that you own the phone, you may be able to ask the deceased person's family to return it to you. If they refuse, you may need to file a lawsuit to get it back. In addition to the legal rights, you may also have some moral rights to the phone. These are rights that are based on your relationship with the deceased person, rather than on the law. For example, you may have a right to access the phone's contents, such as photos, videos, and messages. If the deceased person's family is not willing to cooperate, you may need to hire a lawyer to help you get access to the phone. A lawyer can help you file a lawsuit, if necessary.

Additionally, we are trying to get the results for a lead, asbestos, and mold test their insurance requested and have been promised the results for the last 20 days.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhether or not a landlord can ask for rent of a unit that flooded while taking a month+ to find a suitable temporary unit depends on the specific circumstances of the case and the laws of the state in which the property is located. In general, landlords are responsible for providing habitable housing to their tenants. This means that the landlord must keep the property in good repair and free from hazards, such as mold. If the landlord fails to do so, the tenant may be able to withhold rent or break the lease. However, the law does not always require landlords to provide tenants with temporary housing while their unit is being repaired. In some cases, the landlord may be able to offer the tenant a rent credit or other compensation instead. If you are in this situation, it is important to speak with an attorney who can help you understand your rights and options. The attorney can also help you negotiate with the landlord to reach a fair resolution. In your specific case, it sounds like the landlord has not met their obligation to provide you with habitable housing. The fact that it took them a month and a half to find you a suitable temporary unit is unacceptable. Additionally, the fact that the temporary unit has its own problems is further evidence that the landlord has not met their obligations. You should contact your landlord and demand that they waive your rent for the month during which you were displaced. You should also demand that they pay for any expenses that you incurred as a result of the flooding, such as moving expenses and the cost of replacing damaged property. If the landlord refuses to cooperate, you may need to file a lawsuit against them. A lawsuit may be necessary to get the landlord to take responsibility for their actions and to compensate you for your losses. Here are some additional tips for dealing with a landlord who is not meeting their obligations: * Keep a record of all communications with the landlord, including emails, letters, and phone calls. * Take pictures of the damage to your unit and the temporary unit. * Get estimates from contractors for the cost of repairs. * Contact your insurance company to file a claim. * Contact a tenant's rights organization for help. It is important to remember that you have rights as a tenant. The landlord is not above the law.

However, the process may be more complicated than if the house was not in probate. In general, you can evict a tenant for any reason, as long as you give them proper notice. The amount of notice you must give depends on the state in which you live. In California, for example, you must give a tenant 30 days' notice to vacate. However, if the house is in probate, the executor of the estate may have the right to terminate the tenancy at any time. This is because the executor is responsible for managing the estate's assets, and this may include the right to evict tenants. If you want to evict your roommate, you should first contact the executor of the estate. The executor will be able to tell you if they have the right to evict the roommate, and if so, what the process is for doing so. In addition to the legal requirements, you may also want to consider the practical implications of evicting your roommate. If the roommate is not paying rent, you may be able to get them to leave by simply changing the locks. However, if the roommate is paying rent, you may need to go through the formal eviction process. This can be time-consuming and expensive, so you may want to consider other options, such as asking the roommate to move out on their own. Here are some additional tips for evicting a roommate in probate: * Be sure to document everything. This includes keeping copies of all correspondence with the roommate, as well as any evidence of the roommate's non-payment of rent. * Be patient. The eviction process can take several weeks or even months. * Be prepared to go to court. If the roommate refuses to leave, you may need to file a lawsuit to evict them.

He was collecting Social Security.  36 years ago, he married a woman who, 3 years into the marriage, told him she was going to the store and never came back.  He hasn\u2019t heard from her since then, but I\u2019m not sure if he ever legally divorced her.  He never remarried and he had no assets, so I suspect divorce was a formality he never got around to doing.  Now, 33 years later and 2 weeks after he passed away, the woman has shown up out of nowhere asking my family members for my dad\u2019s birthdate and other personal information so that she may apply for survivor benefits from Social Security.  Is there anything that can be done to stop this?  I called SS and was basically told that it\u2019s none of my business and that as long as she can produce the information they require, she will start receiving survivor benefits.  Information that can be easily obtained online.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, an estranged spouse who abandoned a marriage over 30 years ago may still be entitled to Social Security survivor benefits, depending on the specific circumstances of the marriage and the divorce. In your father's case, it sounds like he was still legally married to his estranged wife at the time of his death, even though they had been separated for many years. This means that she would be eligible to apply for survivor benefits, even though she has not been in contact with him for many years. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a number of factors that it considers when determining whether or not to award survivor benefits to an estranged spouse. These factors include: * The length of the marriage * The reasons for the separation * The financial circumstances of the estranged spouse * Whether or not the estranged spouse has remarried In your father's case, the fact that he and his estranged wife were married for 3 years and that she abandoned him may be enough to qualify her for survivor benefits. However, the SSA will also consider the other factors listed above. If you are concerned that your father's estranged wife may be awarded survivor benefits, you may want to contact an attorney who specializes in Social Security law. Here are some additional things you can do to try to stop the estranged spouse from receiving survivor benefits: * Contact the SSA and request that they investigate the matter. * Provide the SSA with any evidence that you have that your father and his estranged wife were estranged, such as divorce papers, separation agreements, or letters from your father stating that he wanted nothing to do with his estranged wife. * If the SSA denies your request, you may be able to appeal the decision. It is important to note that the SSA is not obligated to award survivor benefits to an estranged spouse. However, if you have evidence that your father and his estranged wife were estranged, you may be able to convince the SSA to deny her application.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Friend made a joke about getting cocaine with his boss during social hour, no witnesses, was fired a week later. - California Employment Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                Friend (FR moving forward) is a new whiskey rep for a distiller owned by a large conglomerate.

If the income in question is tied to active participation in an LLC and subject to self-employment taxes, it could potentially be argued that it should be classified as self-employment income. Consulting with a legal professional familiar with California's child support guidelines is advised for accurate advice\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"I filed a complaint with the California dept of insurance about coercive antagonistic behavior from adjuster - California Insurance Bad Faith Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                he has all my written, visual and taped verbal answers to his questions about my claim.

Once you understand the reason, you can start to negotiate a solution. 2. Check your lease agreement. Your lease agreement may have a clause that covers this situation.

I will do my best to explain and I am asking on behalf of my aunt.  My aunt is currently in a contract to pay off the property where she resides in currently, the end of that is in Feb 2024. The constricts of the contract state that payment of loan is to be paid by then, interest free. Once that is paid she gets the title back to her property. She felt that the person who gave the load will not honor said contract - the only contract that has been signed by both parties - and started to withhold rent due to no communications. Now he is trying to sell the property before the end of this contract and evict her. Can he do that? Can she have what is owed gathered up and pay it off before the end of the contract in 2024?

If the contract does not allow for early sale or eviction, then the person who gave the loan cannot do either of those things. However, if the contract does allow for early sale or eviction, then the person who gave the loan may be able to do those things. If your aunt is concerned that the person who gave the loan will not honor the contract, she should contact a lawyer to review the contract and discuss her options. She may also want to consider paying off the loan early, if she is able to do so. Here are some additional things to keep in mind: * If the person who gave the loan does sell the property, your aunt may be able to stay in the property until the end of the contract, but she will likely be required to pay rent to the new owner. * If the person who gave the loan does evict your aunt, she may be able to challenge the eviction in court. However, if the eviction is successful, your aunt will be required to move out of the property. It is important to note that the laws governing real estate contracts and evictions vary from state to state.

There is no specific universal limit on how much a commercial property owner can raise rents. In some jurisdictions, there may be rent control or rent stabilization laws in place that limit the amount by which rents can be increased and provide specific guidelines for such increases. These laws aim to protect tenants from excessive rent hikes and ensure affordable housing or business premises. However, in areas without rent control or stabilization laws, commercial property owners generally have more flexibility in determining rent increases. The specific terms and conditions of the lease agreement between the property owner and the tenant will play a significant role in defining the extent to which rents can be raised. Lease agreements often include provisions that outline the terms for rent adjustments, such as annual increases based on a predetermined percentage or market conditions. It's important for both landlords and tenants to review and understand the lease agreement and consult with legal professionals or real estate experts who specialize in commercial property to ensure compliance with applicable laws and to navigate any potential disputes.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"What is the least amount a person can be charged with on a murder charge with 2:other co defendants . - California Criminal Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                3 people 2 enter a home 3rd person in a vehicle  Planned robbery at a marijuana grow that was suppose to be empty. 2 guys go in one guy has a gun the other guy does not nor does the guy in the car.

He can not meet his 50% timeshare. what should I do? - California Family Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                Everything has been out of CA. He now lives in WI. Our son is almost 15 years old. My ex- is only asking for 2 weeks of visitation per year, which I agreed to. This would make me the primary caregiver. We have written up terms and my ex won't sign anything. The kicker is he just bought my son a plane ticket to come to visit him and I don't want to let him leave until he signs, what should I do? Because he left the state does that void his 50% custody? Do I have the right to keep my son here?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf your ex-husband has moved out of state without your consent, he may have violated the terms of your custody agreement. This could potentially void his 50% custody, but it's important to consult with an attorney to get specific advice about your situation. In California, the law generally presumes that it is in the best interests of a child to have regular contact with both parents. However, the court will consider a number of factors when deciding whether to modify a custody agreement, including the distance between the parents' homes, the child's age and maturity, and the child's wishes. If your son is almost 15 years old, the court is likely to give significant weight to his wishes. If he does not want to visit his father in Wisconsin, the court may be reluctant to force him to do so. However, the court may also consider whether your ex-husband has made a good faith effort to maintain a relationship with his son. If he has made regular phone calls and sent letters, the court may be more likely to order him to continue to provide visitation. Ultimately, the decision of whether to allow your son to visit his father in Wisconsin is up to the court. If you are concerned about your ex-husband's ability to meet his 50% custody, you should consult with an attorney to discuss your options. In the meantime, you should not prevent your son from going on the trip that his father has already paid for. If you do, you could be found in contempt of court. Here are some things you can do to protect your rights: * Keep a record of all communication with your ex-husband, including phone calls, emails, and text messages. * Document any instances of your ex-husband not meeting his responsibilities as a parent. * Get a lawyer to review your custody agreement and advise you on your options. It is important to remember that your goal is to do what is best for your son. If you can work together with your ex-husband to create a parenting plan that meets the needs of your son, that is the best possible outcome.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"How do I transfer real property after a death? - California Probate Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                My grandmother passed away eight years ago in California without a will. She had real property that has never been passed to her daughter, my mother.  My mother passed away recently.  I intend to file a Petition for Succession of my grandmother's property to go to my mother, but I don't know how to pass along to my mother's name since she passed after my grandmother.   My mother had a will, but her assets will not require a formal probate proceeding. I need to get my mother's interest in the property into her name,  but I'm unclear how to properly indicate how she receives the property. It doesn't sound right to  pass it to her name as she has also passed, however,  there will be no estate proceeding so indicating \"estate of...\" doesn't sound right either.  Can you please advise of the proper wording to pass the property to her under the Petition for Succession?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe proper wording to pass the property to your mother under the Petition for Succession is as follows: I, [Your Name], Petitioner, hereby petition the Court to grant me Letters of Succession to the real property located at [Property Address] that was owned by my grandmother, [Grandmother's Name], who died on [Grandmother's Date of Death]. My mother, [Mother's Name], was the sole heir to my grandmother's estate, but she died on [Mother's Date of Death] without having transferred the property to her name. As a result, I am the rightful heir to the property. You will also need to attach the following documents to your Petition for Succession: * A certified copy of your grandmother's death certificate * A certified copy of your mother's death certificate * Proof that you are the rightful heir to the property, such as a copy of your mother's will or a copy of the court order that appointed you as her executor * A copy of the deed to the property Once you have filed your Petition for Succession, the Court will schedule a hearing. At the hearing, the Judge will review your petition and the attached documents. If the Judge is satisfied that you are the rightful heir to the property, the Judge will grant you Letters of Succession. With Letters of Succession, you will be able to transfer the property into your own name.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Employed by PRIVATE HOUSEHOLD, , NO CONTRACT, Owed in back pay over $50,000+, just since 2021.

First, an employer has no duty to inform you of the reason for placing you on administrative leave, paid or unpaid.  Unless you are in a union environment that has such protections, you can be put on administrative leave at any time and for any reason or even no reason at all. Second, bullying, abuse of authority, and favoritism are not unlawful in a workplace unless you can prove that such conduct is being directed at you because you are a member of a protected class of people or because you engaged in legally protected conduct. Third, while mere numbers will not prove racial discrimination, it can be one factor in an analysis of all the facts that can be used as an element of proof.  Far more persuasive are words that indicate a dislike of your protected class, especially from those who control the decisions being made that you wish to complain about. Fourth, retaliation is not unlawful in the workplace unless you can establish the reason for the retaliation is you engaging in legally protected conduct.   It would be wise for you to locate and consult with an experienced employment law attorney as soon as possible to explore your facts and determine your options.  I would suggest you look either on this site, or go to www.cela.org, the home page for the California Employment Lawyers Association, an organization whose members are dedicated to the representation of employees against their employers. Most employment attorneys who practice this area of law offer a free or low cost consultation in the beginning and then, if the matter has merit and value, will usually agree to work on a contingency basis, meaning you can hire an attorney without paying any money until the matter results in a positive outcome for you. Many advance all the costs of the litigation as well. Do not let fear of fees and costs keep you from finding a good attorney.

You will need to allege that the police department was negligent in their investigation of your daughter's disappearance, and that this negligence caused you harm. You will also need to prove that you suffered damages as a result of the police department's negligence. To prove negligence, you will need to show that the police department had a duty to act, that they breached that duty, that their breach of duty caused your daughter's disappearance, and that you suffered damages as a result of her disappearance. The police department's duty to act arises from their position as law enforcement officers. They have a duty to investigate reports of missing persons and to take steps to locate the missing person. The police department's breach of duty can be shown by showing that they did not investigate your daughter's disappearance properly, or that they did not take all reasonable steps to locate her. The police department's breach of duty must have caused your daughter's disappearance. This means that if the police department had investigated your daughter's disappearance properly, or if they had taken all reasonable steps to locate her, she would not have disappeared. Finally, you must show that you suffered damages as a result of your daughter's disappearance. This could include emotional distress, financial loss, or loss of companionship.

This can be a very stressful and confusing experience, and it is important to understand your rights. In California, a 72-hour hold is also known as a 5150 hold. It is a type of involuntary commitment that can be used to detain someone who is believed to be a danger to themselves or others, or who is gravely disabled. To place someone on a 5150 hold, a law enforcement officer or mental health professional must have probable cause to believe that the person meets the criteria for involuntary commitment. The person must be either a danger to themselves or others, or gravely disabled. Once a person has been placed on a 5150 hold, they will be taken to a mental health facility for evaluation. The facility will then determine whether the person should be released or held for further treatment. In California, a person can only be held on a 5150 hold for a maximum of 72 hours. After 72 hours, the person must be released or a judge must order that they be held for further treatment. If your husband was involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, he has certain rights. These rights include: * The right to be informed of the reason for the commitment * The right to have an attorney present during the evaluation * The right to refuse treatment * The right to a hearing to determine whether the commitment should be continued If you have any questions about your husband's rights, you should contact an attorney. An attorney can help you understand your husband's rights and can represent him in court if necessary. Here are some additional tips for dealing with a 5150 hold: * Be prepared. If you think that you or someone you know may be at risk of being involuntarily committed, it is important to be prepared. You should know your rights and you should have an attorney on standby. * Be calm. If you are involuntarily committed, it is important to stay calm. Do not argue with the police or the mental health professionals. Just cooperate and try to understand the situation. * Get help. If you are involuntarily committed, it is important to get help. Talk to a therapist or counselor and get the support you need.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"What preparations are needed to file for a divorce? - California Divorce Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                The first time filing, mother of three ( 1 stepdaughter). work is a difficult subject to discuss right now, but was working 5-10 hours per week in administrative work for my husband's business ( although he stopped paying me two weeks ago now ).

However, it's advisable to consult with an attorney to ensure compliance with specific regulations and any potential exceptions that may apply. Extended stays outside the US: If your parents plan to stay outside the US for more than 6 months but less than a year, they may encounter scrutiny from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers upon re-entry. Possessing a valid green card and demonstrating immediate family ties in the US, such as having their children residing in the country, can help establish their intent to maintain US residency. However, CBP officers have discretionary authority in determining admissibility, so it's important to be prepared with supporting documentation and be aware that extended absences could raise questions. To ensure you have the most accurate and up-to-date information, it is recommended to consult with an immigration attorney who can assess your parents' specific situation and provide advice based on the current immigration laws and regulations.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"how soon can I get sued from a credit card company for non payment - California Consumer Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                I had 4 cards with American Express, they closed my accounts on feb 5 due to not receiving information. I called them apparently the day that they were gonna close it and when I tried to provide information to them they said the person handling the accounts was busy. They didn't call me until the next day once they closed the accounts .Now they want full payment even though I was paying on time my credit cards and was not behind on payments. They filed a lawsuit online on May 15 and I got served last night at my home. I would have not been defaulted had they not closed my accounts.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerally the timeline for a credit card company to sue you for non-payment can vary. When you miss a payment, the credit card company will typically contact you to remind you of the outstanding balance and try to find a resolution. They may escalate their collection efforts by involving a third-party collection agency if you continue to miss payments. Filing a lawsuit is typically a last resort for credit card companies, and it can happen several months to a few years after missed payments. The specific timeframe depends on various factors, including the terms of your credit card agreement, laws in your jurisdiction, and the credit card company's policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can a physicians assistant disclose you mental health diagnosis on a pre employment physical to an employer? - California Medical Malpractice Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                I went in for a pre employment physical for a job in a preschool. The PA asked if I was taking any meds and when I told him what I take he asked what it was for. I told him bipolar disorder. He asked if my new employer knew about my diagnosis. I said I put that I had a disability on a pre hire form but that was all. He then asked if it would disqualify me if they knew I was bipolar. I said I did not know. He then asked when my lest episode was and said I was good to go. He did not perform any other tests for the physical I was there for except for an eye exam.

Healthcare professionals are generally required to protect your personal health information. However, laws can vary, so it's important to consult a legal professional or local labor authority to understand the specific regulations in your area.

Anyways, the company was quite small when I first joined the company two years ago. They offered me stock options worth about 100k USD at company valuation 1B USD. Two years later, the company valuation became 3Bil USD with additional funding, and we parted ways because the company strategy wasn't a good fit for me.  However, the company wasn't willing to do anything about my stock options that are included in my employment contract. I believe it should be worth at least 200k USD, but there's not enough details on the employment contract (exercise price, vesting period, buyback clause, and etc). I probably should've paid more attention before my employment began with them, but I also think the company is at fault for not including these detail on their offer.

Most employment attorneys who practice this area of law offer a free or low-charge consultation and then if the matter has merit and sufficient value, they work on a contingency basis, meaning you can hire an attorney without paying any money until the matter results in a positive outcome for you.

If not paid w\/in 30 days, assess a one-time 10% penalty, plus .5% monthly interest for past-due balances.  If customer has a past-due balance, utility company then puts \"DUE UPON RECEIPT\" on the monthly bill and imposing a 10% penalty on the CURRENT CHARGES if paid after the due date, which is the same day the customer gets the invoice. Thus, unless the customer can completely pay the past due balance AND the current balance the day the invoice is received, another 10% penalty is applied.  EXAMPLE: Jan 1 invoice for $300 in utilities. Customer makes $100 payment on Jan 30.  New invoice on Feb 1 with $20 penalty for $200 past-due + $300 in new utilities.  Total due: $520.

To avoid this you would have to pay off the current balance 100$.  I would question the March 1 $30 charge because your past due is only $220, so they overcharged you on the penalty.  One of the problems with fighting with your utility company is that they always have the last word and if you don't pay what they demand, they cut off your service and then won't allow you to have an account with them.  It isn't fair or right but that's the way it is.  There are also programs for people to spread out utility bill payments when the utility has high and low seasons (i.e. gas bill in the mountains where colder in winter, more gas for heating)  You should look into your utility to see if they have such a program.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"I work remote for a California based company.

The HOA (Homeowners Association) usually has the authority to enforce the CC&R provisions. However, the extent of the HOA's oversight and enforcement regarding maintenance obligations can vary depending on the specific provisions outlined in the governing documents. Some HOAs may have policies or rules in place to ensure that homeowners comply with their maintenance responsibilities, while others may have limited involvement. It is advisable to review your specific CC&R's and any additional rules or policies established by the HOA to determine the extent of the HOA's responsibility and oversight. If you have concerns about a homeowner failing to maintain their exclusive-use balcony, it may be appropriate to notify the HOA and provide them with relevant information.

For example, if your lease starts on May 25, 2023, a 12-month lease should end on May 24, 2024. However, they assert that according to their internal policy, all leases need to end on a Monday. Thus, they changed the end date to May 20, 2024, which will result in us losing 4 days' rent. Considering how high their rental fee is, several days' rent can amount to hundreds of dollars for each unit. When considering the lost rent from all affected hundreds of tenants for these days, the cumulative amount becomes substantial. I asked the management\/leasing office to show us a copy of this so-called internal policy, but no one responded to our request. Could you please let me know if this is allowed under California tenant-landlord law? I have lived in many apartments in Missouri, DC, and NYC before, but never encountered this.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYour landlord is legally bound by the terms of the lease contract, just the same as you are.

Historically, this is how he's paid--by wire. I'm in the process of returning his partial payment but would like to avoid receiving partial payments in the future.

What I'd like to do is start using a rent payment service that will continue to allow tenants to pay via ACH wire deposit if they'd like, but which I can set to only accept full rent payments. They could then pay by check or by ACH wire. My question is, do you know if I have to give 30 days notice to tenants to tell them about this change? Since I'm not requiring them to pay by wire and am only changing the method by which they can choose to do it, does this require 30 days notice?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou don't have to give 30 day's notice that you require 100$ payment of the rent not a partial, it is in the lease.

They told me that they would call me back on Monday after they talked to manager but they didn't call me back. Apparently my sister added me to her account so they put me on her account without my permission and without talking to me or seeing my identification. And now they're trying to get money from me to go pick up my car that I never gave them permission to store nor did they ask to see proof of ownership, which I have.  ** I'm adding to this.

The reason that I advise this course of action is that the law requires you to minimize your damages (mitigation) and if you just let the storage facility keep the car and increase the amount for rent, you are not minimizing your damages.

You might want to post under \"Divorce\" or \"Family law\" for an attorney to assist you to sever your relationship with your wife.   \"White collar crime\" doesn't usually refer to any kind of vandalism, and certainly doesn't refer to these facts, so you need to post under \"Criminal Law\" if the police are charging you or \"personal injury\" if the guy us suing you.   Doesn't sound like much of a case by him against you, a window crayon on a window is not permanent damage.   It does sound like you are heading down a dangerous road of reporting cheating spouses and possible further physical retaliation to your person or property.

California law does allow tip pooling, though. An employer may require a group of employees to pool together their tips, which are then distributed among the employees in the pool. However, California employers must follow certain guidelines in order to create a valid tip pool. The first guideline seems the one that applies here, only certain employees can be included in the tip pool. Employees may be included in the tip pool only if they are in the \"chain of service\" that results in a tip from a particular customer. In general, servers, bartenders, hosts, and bussers are considered to be in the chain of service, while cooks, dishwashers, and cashiers are not. The one exception to the \"chain of service\" rule is that managers and supervisors cannot partake in the tip pool even if they provide direct table service. From your description it appears that the tip is shared with other employees not in the chain of service.  You might want to discuss this with the local office of the California Labor Commissioner, which is a part of the Department of Industrial relations. They have a website that addresses many questions like yours.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"In california  is my employer allowed to force me to tip a portion of my earned tips to cooks and dishwashers? - California Employment Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                Employer take 2% of my sales and makes me give it to the cooks dishwasher and prep cook.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabor Code 351 prohibits an employer from collecting any tip money left for a server, however, that isn't the end of the question.
