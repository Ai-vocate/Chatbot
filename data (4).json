Do they all need to hire other law firms to defend themselves (defend the landlord and defend the landlord\u2019s law firm) to avoid conflict of interest?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo. A conflict of interest would arise if the law firm previously represented you in the same or a substantially similar matter. The landlord's interests and the law firm's interests are aligned in defending the claims brought by you.  So there is no conflict of interest. Assuming you can overcome the privilege in connection with statements made during or in furtherance of litigation, the specific lawyer making the specific statement may be precluded from representing the law firm at trial if that lawyer will be a fact witness on a disputed question of fact, but another lawyer from the same firm would still be able to represent the law firm.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Just discovered tax lien on previous aircraft owner in 2007 from S.B.

Some courts\u2019 records are online and others have an app, so you can check those from home. But our government  is generally behind the times, which is why I suggested you go in person to check. (For example, in Monterey County, they save real estate deeds on microfiche. You may be too young to have heard of that, but suffice it to say it\u2019s incredibly outdated technology!) Back to your question, if you are almost at the final hearing, that means the case has been pending for a year or more. Has the adoption issue been raised thus far? If you don\u2019t know, you\u2019ll want to find out because, if the judge already ruled on that issue, the judge will not appreciate having it raised again. Talk with your lawyer or hire a lawyer to help you raise it through a Motion or speak to your step-siblings\u2019 lawyer to ask for the proof outside of court.

A 14 year old has asked to join my business\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst, it is unlikely that if you are employing someone to carry out the core function of your business (i.e., dog sitting) that you can characterize them as an independent contractor.  If you try to call this person an IC, you may well face a lawsuit that could be very expensive to you. Second, you can employ a 14 year old only under limited conditions.  Weekly hour restrictions and work during school sessions vary by age. In general, California allows minors between 14 and 17 to work while school is in session, but hours may be limited.  It would be wise for you to consult with an attorney who regularly advises employers before you bring on any new people, and if you have other people working for you that you treat as independent contractors, you need to correct that problem right away.

This may be your best approach in your situation. You will have time to submit additional evidence if the decision is unfavorable and you appeal the claim to the Administrative Law Judge level. While you wait for the reconsideration decision, you can interview experienced disability attorneys to find one that would work with you in the event of an appeal.  As soon as possible, make sure that Social Security is aware that your attorney has withdrawn from you case. If the attorney has not informed Social Security, you can complete and file a Revocation of Appointment with Social Security. https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/forms\/ssa-1696-sup1.pdf.  If your former representative requests a fee for services performed in the case on your behalf, Social Security will authorize a fee only for services performed before the date the appointment was terminated. https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/OP_Home\/hallex\/I-01\/I-1-1-30.html.  If you do not have all of the medical records and other evidence in file with Social Security, your other option is to hire an experienced disability lawyer now to help you prove your claim.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Is there any Labor laws that have to do with base pay restructure without additional earned raises from yearly evals - California Employment Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn short, no.

I completed 27 out of 52 classes. I went to pick up my referral for the DV class from probation and now it says the referral is for stalking class.  I caught a stalking charge in 2017. A whole different case from the domestic violence case. My public defender or the judge  did not address anything about having to take classes for stalking. So I don't understand why probation switched it up on me telling me I need enroll in the Domestic Violence class but on the referral it says stalking class. I believe they did that because my probation is over next month for the Domestic Violence case and they want me to continue for that class so they change it to stalking. They can't do that if it's not ordered by the court or a judge to take classes for stalking. Please help me I need answers to this. If my probation is up In a month.

Review the court orders and probation terms for both cases to identify any explicit instructions regarding classes or treatment programs. If necessary, consult with a criminal law attorney who can provide specialized guidance based on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

In usa - California Immigration Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                I have been outside usa more than year according to naturalization rule Embassy\/ field office has no help for me in India How to reenter usa should I pay Any penalty to reenter or what are other options to reenter USA\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder the general rule, If you are a permanent legal resident and intend to stay outside the United States for 1 year or more, you must apply for a re-entry permit with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) prior to leaving the United States. A re-entry permit allows a lawful permanent resident to apply for admission to the United States upon returning from abroad during the permit\u2019s validity without the need to obtain a returning resident visa from a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate. Re-entry permits are generally valid for 2 years from the date of issuance. Therefore, if you are outside of the United States longer than the date the permit was issued (assuming no permit was requested in your case) or, if you are overseas in excess of 1 year, you may be denied entry into the United States. The key word is \"may\" because the CBP officer may grant entry for good cause shown or may deny it and consider the permanent residency status abandoned. In practice, there are many cases when green card holders are allowed entry after 1 year period, especially if no previous warning was noted. I think the airline will allow you to board the flight to the USA if your Green Card is not expired. If the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer believes you do not intend to continue living permanently in the United States, he\/she may revoke your status as a permanent resident. At that point, it is better to have a stand-by attorney who may represent you. You should take into account that every case is unique and it is strongly recommended to discuss your particular case with an immigration attorney and be duly prepared for a negative outcome on re-entry.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can I name my company Smooch if there is a company named Smoochcraft in the same industry? - California Business Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                The names I am using are not real companies but the answers applies to the company I am trying to start.

Ordinarily, a late fee is charged only when the borrower makes a payment later (hence the name \"late\" fee).   Car loans generally are not assumable, so it would be a highly unusual transaction if you assumed a previous car loan to another borrower that somehow already had accrued $2,600 in late fees.  Typically, a new owner of a previously-owned vehicle takes out their own loan for the purchase of the used vehicle, and the proceeds of that loan pay off the previous loan of the prior owner.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can a non profit give to the CEOs side business? - California Contracts Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                I'm on the board of a animal welfare\/rights organization and the CEO has a side business where he only provides foods that our vegan.
