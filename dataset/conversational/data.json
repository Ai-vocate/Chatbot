The agency is in Ohio\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can sue anyone for anything, but that doesn't mean the lawsuit will be successful. If you haven't already done so, you should have a lawyer send a demand letter asking the company to cooperate and prove the beneficiaries have been notified. It's possible that the beneficiaries are people you weren't expecting and those people HAVE BEEN notified. Often, people set up investment accounts (or buy life insurance) and name beneficiaries decades before they pass away then forget to update the beneficiaries as their lives change. I've seen people pass away and their accounts went to an ex-spouse because the beneficiaries were never updated. So, even if you think you know the beneficiaries, you may be surprised at who they are.

I'm trying to start a non-profit organization that sponsors scholarships to humanities students, from a fund in the organization.

I'd be happy to help you understand California Corporations Code \u00a7 5240 subsection (c) and its implications for your nonprofit organization. California Corporations Code \u00a7 5240 subsection (c) pertains to the distribution of assets upon the dissolution of a nonprofit organization. Here's an explanation of the subsection in simpler terms: The subsection states that upon the dissolution of a nonprofit organization, any remaining assets must be distributed to another nonprofit organization with a similar purpose, to the federal government, or to a state or local government. If the organization has specific provisions in its governing documents (such as articles of incorporation or bylaws) regarding the distribution of assets upon dissolution, those provisions will prevail over subsection (c) unless they are inconsistent with California law. If the organization's governing documents are silent on the matter of asset distribution upon dissolution, subsection (c) comes into effect as the default rule. In summary, subsection (c) ensures that when a nonprofit organization is dissolved, its remaining assets are directed towards other charitable or governmental entities, rather than being distributed to private individuals or shareholders.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can I submit an i589 to USCIS or can I only submit an I589 to EOIR in my current situation? - California Immigration Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                In late December 2022, I(from China mainland\uff09entered the U.S. illegally through the wall from Mexico, and was caught by CBP and held in the border detention center.

The relevant sections of code, Rule 7.55 and Probate Code 10954, outline the requirements for waivers of accounting and executor compensation in probate proceedings. It's important to consult with a probate attorney to understand how these rules specifically apply to your case.

My apartment approved but won't stop charging pet rent until end of lease - California Landlord - Tenant Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                My lease ends in July but I have paid pet rent even after submitting and getting approved by the apartment for my ESA certified cat. They also won't give me back my deposit for my cat (had to pay $200) until the lease ends. My roommate also has a cat that is not registered under our lease (the lease states that the only approved cat is mine). I tried to report my roommates cat and the apartment states that the pet rent covers a \"pet friendly\" apartment not just my cat. My roommate's cat has also brought fleas into the apartment hence why I wanted to report it. The lease doesn't state that with the pet rent and me registering my cat it is a fully pet friendly apartment. Please help me, I don't know where I stand or what I can do about this\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI understand your concerns regarding your emotional support animal (ESA) and the charges related to pet rent and your roommate's cat.  Here are a few points to consider: ESA Approval and Pet Rent: It's positive that your apartment approved your ESA certification. However, if you are still being charged pet rent despite having an approved ESA, it may be worth discussing the matter directly with your apartment management. Present them with the documentation supporting your ESA status and inquire about the continued charges. They may have made an oversight or be unaware of your ESA status. Cat Deposit: Regarding the deposit for your cat, the policy to withhold it until the lease ends might be outlined in your lease agreement. Review the lease document carefully to understand the terms and conditions associated with the cat deposit. If you believe there is an error or discrepancy, you can discuss it with your apartment management and provide any relevant documentation to support your case. Roommate's Cat: It seems there may be confusion regarding the pet policy and your roommate's cat. If the lease clearly states that only your cat is approved, and your roommate's cat is not registered or included in the lease, it may be necessary to have a conversation with your apartment management to address the issue. Inform them of the situation and the concerns you have, such as the presence of fleas. They should be able to clarify their pet policy and provide guidance on how to proceed. I hope you find a resolution to these issues, and I wish you the best of luck in resolving the matter amicably.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Do I have a discrimination or some other kind of case? - California Civil Rights Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                I recently applied for a grant program in the state of California. I just received an email saying that because of the area I live in that they declined my application due to it not being a low income area. I recently lost my job and in turn lost my car.

Grant programs often have specific criteria for eligibility, and decisions are based on those guidelines. Without reviewing the program's requirements, it's challenging to determine if discrimination has occurred. If you believe you have experienced discrimination based on a protected characteristic, such as race or gender, consulting with an attorney specializing in discrimination law is recommended. In the meantime, it may be helpful to explore local assistance programs for support with essential needs. Additionally, consider reaching out to legal aid organizations and career development centers in your area for further guidance.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"What are the guidelines for salary exempt? Scheduling 50 hours not paying for time missed and no sick pay or vacation - California Employment Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                The employer tells staff he is paying them for 50 hours of work (salary) only paying for 40 but scheduling 50 hours and there is no paid sick days and no paid vacation so whatever the reason if there is any time missed it has to be made up. Is this legal?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere are some points to consider: Salary Exemption: To be considered exempt from overtime pay under federal law (Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA), employees must meet certain criteria related to job duties, responsibilities, and salary requirements. Exempt employees generally receive a fixed salary regardless of the number of hours worked. Hours Worked: If an exempt employee is scheduled to work 50 hours but is only being paid for 40, this may raise concerns. Generally, exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay, but they must receive their full salary for any week in which they perform work, subject to specific exceptions. Sick Days and Vacation: Paid sick days and vacation time are not federally mandated, but some states and local jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring employers to provide these benefits. You should review the laws in your specific location to determine the requirements. Time Missed and Make-Up: Deducting pay or requiring make-up time for partial-day absences of exempt employees can affect their exempt status. Generally, if an exempt employee is ready and available for work but misses part of a day due to personal reasons, their salary should not be docked for that absence. However, deductions may be allowed for full-day absences or under certain circumstances such as FMLA leave. It's important to note that employment laws can vary depending on your jurisdiction, so consulting with an employment attorney is crucial to determine the specific legal requirements applicable to your situation. If you believe your employer may be violating labor laws, you may want to document any relevant details, such as work schedules, hours worked, and any communication with your employer. This documentation could be helpful if you decide to pursue a legal course of action.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"How can I stop EDD from levying my checks ?

Here are a few steps you can consider taking to address the issue: Contact the EDD: It's essential to reach out to the EDD directly to understand the specifics of the levy and explore potential options for resolution. Explain your situation and inquire about any possible remedies or payment arrangements that could alleviate the financial burden. Seek Legal Assistance: Given the complexity of your situation, consulting with a qualified attorney who specializes in tax and employment law is highly recommended. They can provide personalized advice based on the details of your case and help navigate the legal processes involved in resolving the levy. Review your Payroll Processes: Assess your internal payroll procedures to identify any gaps or errors that may have contributed to the situation. Consider working with a professional payroll service or an experienced accountant to ensure compliance with all EDD requirements moving forward. Seek Financial Assistance: If you're facing homelessness and unable to make payroll, it may be beneficial to explore resources available in your community that provide financial assistance to small businesses in distress. Local business development centers, small business associations, or nonprofit organizations may offer guidance and support during challenging times. Remember, each case is unique, and it's important to consult with professionals who can provide legal and financial advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

He may wish to consult with an attorney to make a special appearance on his behalf based on \"lack of jurisdiction\".  Since he was already legally married 13 years ago, and assuming that marriage was properly recorded and no dissolution obtained, a second \"marriage\" would not be legal.  It appears the woman is trying to impose a \"common law marriage\" by claiming to have lived with the man for 8 years and having his children.  I do not believe California is a common law marriage state, but does recognize legally-binding common law marriages from other states.  Since the woman lacks a marriage certificate of any kind, and the man can produce proof he is legally married to someone else, he should probably file a \"Special Appearance\" objection\/motion for dismissal of the action based on fraud and lack of jurisdiction.  The woman may have valid claims for child support if any of her children are his biologically. That would be a separate matter.  I would recommend a demand for DNA testing should she file for that unless the man knows the children are his.  If he did live with this woman for 8 years and held himself out to be her husband, there could be a civil claim for one-half of all assets the two acquired during the time they lived together.

This is because it allows the petitioner to proactively correct the errors and ensure that the information in the I-130 and I-130A forms accurately reflects their address history. The petitioner should gather any relevant documentation to support the correct dates, such as utility bills, lease agreements, or other official records that show their address history.

However, there are a few things that you can do to help improve her chances of approval. First, you should gather any documentation that you can find that supports her address history. This could include things like school records, medical records, or letters from friends or family members. Even if the documentation is not official, it can still be helpful in proving that your wife lived at the addresses that she has listed. Second, you should be prepared to explain why your wife does not have any documentation to support her address history. For example, you could explain that she lived in a rural area where it was difficult to obtain official records, or that she moved frequently and lost her old records. Finally, you should be prepared to answer any questions that the immigration officer may have about your wife's address history.

However, without more specific information about the circumstances, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. If a child has been living with their parents for eight months and there are no known concerns or issues that would warrant intervention by DCFS, it is less likely for them to detain the child from the legal guardians. Generally, DCFS aims to prioritize the safety and well-being of the child and may only intervene if there is evidence of abuse, neglect, or an unsafe living environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"How much time does our neighbor legally have to finish the construction of the common wall between us? - California Real Estate Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                We have a rental and one of the neighbors is doing construction very slowly and our tenants are getting upset due the noise alone but we are aware we can\u2019t do much.

Liability insurance typically covers damages or injuries caused to other parties involved in an accident for which you are found legally responsible.

However, if you have collision coverage, you may choose to use your own insurance to cover the repairs instead of waiting for the other party's insurance to process the claim. In this case, you would need to pay your own deductible, which is the agreed-upon amount you are responsible for before the insurance kicks in. In some cases, you may be able to pursue the other party's insurance to reimburse your deductible, but it depends on the circumstances and the specific terms of your insurance policy.

This is the 2nd time I have documented the request to refrain from contacting her and they continue to proceed with harassing someone I don\u2019t even speak with advising of late payment when I am not late.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn California, landlords have certain rights and responsibilities regarding their tenants. Typically, landlords are not allowed to disclose information about a tenant's lease or rental agreement to someone who is not a party to that agreement, unless the tenant has given explicit consent or unless required by law. If your landlord contacted someone who is not on your lease and has no affiliation with the rental property, it could potentially be a violation of your privacy rights. Landlords should generally respect the privacy of their tenants and communicate directly with them regarding any issues related to the lease, including late rent payments. If you have documented your request for the landlord to refrain from contacting this person and they continue to do so, you may want to consult with a local attorney or a legal aid organization to understand your rights and explore potential courses of action. They can provide you with specific advice based on the details of your situation and the applicable laws in your area. Keep in mind that landlord-tenant laws can vary, so it's important to consult with a legal professional familiar with the laws in your jurisdiction for accurate advice.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can someone on F-1 OPT own a business? - California Immigration Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                Let's say that someone is currently on an F-1 visa and working on Optional Practical Training (OPT) at some company and the job position is directly related to their study. Now alongside that employment, they want to own a business, which is not related to my formal education. The intention is not to leave the current job, but rather to operate this business concurrently. My primary question revolves around the legality of owning an LLC or business, as well as the collection of profits, given the visa status. While they may not receive direct payment, the intention is to collect profits generated by the business. I am curious to know if this is legally permissible under my current visa category.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, someone on an F-1 visa can own a business, but there are some restrictions. Under F-1 visa, international students are not allowed to work in the US unless they have authorization. Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a type of employment authorization that allows F-1 students to work in the US after graduation for up to 12 months. If you are currently on OPT and want to start a business, you will need to make sure that your business is related to your field of study. You will also need to make sure that you do not violate any of the terms of your OPT authorization. Here are some things to keep in mind: * You must obtain a Social Security number (SSN) for your business. * You must file taxes for your business. * You must comply with all applicable state and federal laws. * You must not work more than 20 hours per week on your business while you are on OPT. If you are unsure whether or not you can start a business while you are on OPT, you should consult with an immigration attorney. As for collecting profits, you can do so as long as you are paying taxes on them. However, you cannot use the profits to support yourself in the US. The profits must be used to support the business. If you are planning to leave the US and return to your home country, you can take the profits with you. However, you will need to pay taxes on them when you do so. It is important to note that starting a business while you are on F-1 visa can be risky. If you are not careful, you could violate the terms of your visa and be deported. If you are considering starting a business while you are on F-1 visa, you should carefully weigh the risks and benefits. You should also consult with an immigration attorney to make sure that you are in compliance with all applicable laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Can i fill out i-864 as joint sponsor instead of a household member even though I live with the petitioner\/main sponsor - California Immigration Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                On Ceac, I listed myself as a joint sponsor rather than a household member sponsor.

The USCIS may question why the petitioner\/main sponsor and the joint sponsor have the same address. However, as long as you can provide proof of your income and assets, and you can show that you can support the immigrant financially, there should be no problem. Here are some things you can do to show that you can support the immigrant financially: * Provide proof of your income, such as a copy of your most recent pay stub or tax return. * Provide proof of your assets, such as a copy of your bank statements or investment accounts. * Write a letter explaining why you are willing to sponsor the immigrant and how you will support them financially.

If you are a joint sponsor, you are legally responsible for the immigrant's support. This means that if the immigrant becomes a public charge, you may be required to pay for their expenses.

If they were not registered, then you should contact a lawyer to file a motion to vacate the default judgment in County2.

The fact that the correctional officers are not filing his paperwork for a transfer is also a problem.

In California, the law generally considers personal property to be part of the deceased person's estate. This means that the phone would likely be inherited by the deceased person's closest relatives, such as their spouse, children, or parents. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. One exception is if you paid for the phone. If you can prove that you paid for the phone, you may be able to claim ownership of it. You can do this by providing documentation, such as receipts or bank statements. Another exception is if you have a written agreement with the deceased person that gives you ownership of the phone. This could be a contract, a lease, or even just a simple agreement in writing. If you can prove that you own the phone, you may be able to ask the deceased person's family to return it to you. If they refuse, you may need to file a lawsuit to get it back. In addition to the legal rights, you may also have some moral rights to the phone. These are rights that are based on your relationship with the deceased person, rather than on the law. For example, you may have a right to access the phone's contents, such as photos, videos, and messages.

In general, landlords are responsible for providing habitable housing to their tenants. This means that the landlord must keep the property in good repair and free from hazards, such as mold. If the landlord fails to do so, the tenant may be able to withhold rent or break the lease. However, the law does not always require landlords to provide tenants with temporary housing while their unit is being repaired. In some cases, the landlord may be able to offer the tenant a rent credit or other compensation instead. If you are in this situation, it is important to speak with an attorney who can help you understand your rights and options. The attorney can also help you negotiate with the landlord to reach a fair resolution. In your specific case, it sounds like the landlord has not met their obligation to provide you with habitable housing. The fact that it took them a month and a half to find you a suitable temporary unit is unacceptable. Additionally, the fact that the temporary unit has its own problems is further evidence that the landlord has not met their obligations. You should contact your landlord and demand that they waive your rent for the month during which you were displaced. You should also demand that they pay for any expenses that you incurred as a result of the flooding, such as moving expenses and the cost of replacing damaged property. If the landlord refuses to cooperate, you may need to file a lawsuit against them. A lawsuit may be necessary to get the landlord to take responsibility for their actions and to compensate you for your losses. Here are some additional tips for dealing with a landlord who is not meeting their obligations: * Keep a record of all communications with the landlord, including emails, letters, and phone calls. * Take pictures of the damage to your unit and the temporary unit. * Get estimates from contractors for the cost of repairs. * Contact your insurance company to file a claim. * Contact a tenant's rights organization for help.

However, the process may be more complicated than if the house was not in probate. In general, you can evict a tenant for any reason, as long as you give them proper notice. The amount of notice you must give depends on the state in which you live. In California, for example, you must give a tenant 30 days' notice to vacate. However, if the house is in probate, the executor of the estate may have the right to terminate the tenancy at any time. This is because the executor is responsible for managing the estate's assets, and this may include the right to evict tenants. If you want to evict your roommate, you should first contact the executor of the estate. The executor will be able to tell you if they have the right to evict the roommate, and if so, what the process is for doing so. In addition to the legal requirements, you may also want to consider the practical implications of evicting your roommate. If the roommate is not paying rent, you may be able to get them to leave by simply changing the locks. However, if the roommate is paying rent, you may need to go through the formal eviction process. This can be time-consuming and expensive, so you may want to consider other options, such as asking the roommate to move out on their own. Here are some additional tips for evicting a roommate in probate: * Be sure to document everything. This includes keeping copies of all correspondence with the roommate, as well as any evidence of the roommate's non-payment of rent. * Be patient. The eviction process can take several weeks or even months. * Be prepared to go to court. If the roommate refuses to leave, you may need to file a lawsuit to evict them. If you are having difficulty evicting your roommate, you may want to contact an attorney who specializes in landlord-tenant law. The attorney can help you understand your rights and options, and can represent you in court if necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Is an estranged spouse who abandoned a marriage over 30 years ago still entitled to SS survivor benefits? - California Estate Planning Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                My father died recently at age 66.  He was collecting Social Security.  36 years ago, he married a woman who, 3 years into the marriage, told him she was going to the store and never came back.  He hasn\u2019t heard from her since then, but I\u2019m not sure if he ever legally divorced her.  He never remarried and he had no assets, so I suspect divorce was a formality he never got around to doing.  Now, 33 years later and 2 weeks after he passed away, the woman has shown up out of nowhere asking my family members for my dad\u2019s birthdate and other personal information so that she may apply for survivor benefits from Social Security.  Is there anything that can be done to stop this?  I called SS and was basically told that it\u2019s none of my business and that as long as she can produce the information they require, she will start receiving survivor benefits.  Information that can be easily obtained online.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, an estranged spouse who abandoned a marriage over 30 years ago may still be entitled to Social Security survivor benefits, depending on the specific circumstances of the marriage and the divorce. In your father's case, it sounds like he was still legally married to his estranged wife at the time of his death, even though they had been separated for many years. This means that she would be eligible to apply for survivor benefits, even though she has not been in contact with him for many years. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a number of factors that it considers when determining whether or not to award survivor benefits to an estranged spouse. These factors include: * The length of the marriage * The reasons for the separation * The financial circumstances of the estranged spouse * Whether or not the estranged spouse has remarried In your father's case, the fact that he and his estranged wife were married for 3 years and that she abandoned him may be enough to qualify her for survivor benefits. However, the SSA will also consider the other factors listed above. If you are concerned that your father's estranged wife may be awarded survivor benefits, you may want to contact an attorney who specializes in Social Security law. Here are some additional things you can do to try to stop the estranged spouse from receiving survivor benefits: * Contact the SSA and request that they investigate the matter. * Provide the SSA with any evidence that you have that your father and his estranged wife were estranged, such as divorce papers, separation agreements, or letters from your father stating that he wanted nothing to do with his estranged wife. * If the SSA denies your request, you may be able to appeal the decision. It is important to note that the SSA is not obligated to award survivor benefits to an estranged spouse. However, if you have evidence that your father and his estranged wife were estranged, you may be able to convince the SSA to deny her application.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"Friend made a joke about getting cocaine with his boss during social hour, no witnesses, was fired a week later. - California Employment Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                Friend (FR moving forward) is a new whiskey rep for a distiller owned by a large conglomerate.

There is no specific universal limit on how much a commercial property owner can raise rents. In some jurisdictions, there may be rent control or rent stabilization laws in place that limit the amount by which rents can be increased and provide specific guidelines for such increases. These laws aim to protect tenants from excessive rent hikes and ensure affordable housing or business premises. However, in areas without rent control or stabilization laws, commercial property owners generally have more flexibility in determining rent increases. The specific terms and conditions of the lease agreement between the property owner and the tenant will play a significant role in defining the extent to which rents can be raised. Lease agreements often include provisions that outline the terms for rent adjustments, such as annual increases based on a predetermined percentage or market conditions. It's important for both landlords and tenants to review and understand the lease agreement and consult with legal professionals or real estate experts who specialize in commercial property to ensure compliance with applicable laws and to navigate any potential disputes.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"What is the least amount a person can be charged with on a murder charge with 2:other co defendants . - California Criminal Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                3 people 2 enter a home 3rd person in a vehicle  Planned robbery at a marijuana grow that was suppose to be empty. 2 guys go in one guy has a gun the other guy does not nor does the guy in the car.

The original lease you quoted states that \"Neither we nor any of our representatives have made any oral promises, representations, or agreements. This Lease Contract is the entire agreement between you and us.\" This means that the landlord cannot make any changes to the lease orally. However, the lease also states that \"Our representatives (including management personnel, employees, and agents) have no authority to waive, amend, or terminate this Lease Contract or any part of it, unless in writing.\" This means that the landlord's representatives cannot make any changes to the lease without the landlord's written consent.

Here are some things to consider when deciding whether or not to accept the signed email: *The nature of the error * The specific language of the lease * The landlord's willingness to cooperate * Your own comfort level If you are not comfortable with the signed email, you should not sign the new lease.

We have written up terms and my ex won't sign anything. The kicker is he just bought my son a plane ticket to come to visit him and I don't want to let him leave until he signs, what should I do? Because he left the state does that void his 50% custody? Do I have the right to keep my son here?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf your ex-husband has moved out of state without your consent, he may have violated the terms of your custody agreement. This could potentially void his 50% custody, but it's important to consult with an attorney to get specific advice about your situation. In California, the law generally presumes that it is in the best interests of a child to have regular contact with both parents. However, the court will consider a number of factors when deciding whether to modify a custody agreement, including the distance between the parents' homes, the child's age and maturity, and the child's wishes. If your son is almost 15 years old, the court is likely to give significant weight to his wishes. If he does not want to visit his father in Wisconsin, the court may be reluctant to force him to do so. However, the court may also consider whether your ex-husband has made a good faith effort to maintain a relationship with his son. If he has made regular phone calls and sent letters, the court may be more likely to order him to continue to provide visitation. Ultimately, the decision of whether to allow your son to visit his father in Wisconsin is up to the court. If you are concerned about your ex-husband's ability to meet his 50% custody, you should consult with an attorney to discuss your options. In the meantime, you should not prevent your son from going on the trip that his father has already paid for. If you do, you could be found in contempt of court. Here are some things you can do to protect your rights: * Keep a record of all communication with your ex-husband, including phone calls, emails, and text messages. * Document any instances of your ex-husband not meeting his responsibilities as a parent. * Get a lawyer to review your custody agreement and advise you on your options. It is important to remember that your goal is to do what is best for your son. If you can work together with your ex-husband to create a parenting plan that meets the needs of your son, that is the best possible outcome.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"How do I transfer real property after a death? - California Probate Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                My grandmother passed away eight years ago in California without a will.

I intend to file a Petition for Succession of my grandmother's property to go to my mother, but I don't know how to pass along to my mother's name since she passed after my grandmother.   My mother had a will, but her assets will not require a formal probate proceeding. I need to get my mother's interest in the property into her name,  but I'm unclear how to properly indicate how she receives the property. It doesn't sound right to  pass it to her name as she has also passed, however,  there will be no estate proceeding so indicating \"estate of...\" doesn't sound right either.  Can you please advise of the proper wording to pass the property to her under the Petition for Succession?\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe proper wording to pass the property to your mother under the Petition for Succession is as follows: I, [Your Name], Petitioner, hereby petition the Court to grant me Letters of Succession to the real property located at [Property Address] that was owned by my grandmother, [Grandmother's Name], who died on [Grandmother's Date of Death]. My mother, [Mother's Name], was the sole heir to my grandmother's estate, but she died on [Mother's Date of Death] without having transferred the property to her name. As a result, I am the rightful heir to the property. You will also need to attach the following documents to your Petition for Succession: * A certified copy of your grandmother's death certificate * A certified copy of your mother's death certificate * Proof that you are the rightful heir to the property, such as a copy of your mother's will or a copy of the court order that appointed you as her executor * A copy of the deed to the property Once you have filed your Petition for Succession, the Court will schedule a hearing. At the hearing, the Judge will review your petition and the attached documents.

Is it right that i was put on an investigation leave without telling me the exact nature of charges against me and who my accusers are? T.Y.\n            ","answer":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a lot in your post.  I will try to break it down. First, an employer has no duty to inform you of the reason for placing you on administrative leave, paid or unpaid.  Unless you are in a union environment that has such protections, you can be put on administrative leave at any time and for any reason or even no reason at all. Second, bullying, abuse of authority, and favoritism are not unlawful in a workplace unless you can prove that such conduct is being directed at you because you are a member of a protected class of people or because you engaged in legally protected conduct. Third, while mere numbers will not prove racial discrimination, it can be one factor in an analysis of all the facts that can be used as an element of proof.  Far more persuasive are words that indicate a dislike of your protected class, especially from those who control the decisions being made that you wish to complain about. Fourth, retaliation is not unlawful in the workplace unless you can establish the reason for the retaliation is you engaging in legally protected conduct.   It would be wise for you to locate and consult with an experienced employment law attorney as soon as possible to explore your facts and determine your options.  I would suggest you look either on this site, or go to www.cela.org, the home page for the California Employment Lawyers Association, an organization whose members are dedicated to the representation of employees against their employers. Most employment attorneys who practice this area of law offer a free or low cost consultation in the beginning and then, if the matter has merit and value, will usually agree to work on a contingency basis, meaning you can hire an attorney without paying any money until the matter results in a positive outcome for you. Many advance all the costs of the litigation as well. Do not let fear of fees and costs keep you from finding a good attorney. Good luck to you.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"In an unlawful detainer jury trial for nuisance the jury said I did not violate or breach my lease and refused to answer - California Real Estate Law Questions & Answers - Justia Ask a Lawyer\n                #3 that asked if I breach my lease, and they answered also that I was retaliated against for exercising my tenant rights but the Judge still evicted me from my SRO ?

The specific terminology and requirements for these notices can vary depending on local laws and the terms of the lease agreement, so it's important to consult with a qualified attorney or legal professional to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations in your jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t\t\t"},{"question":"I had my house repainted; after 15mths the paint is peeling off most windows.
